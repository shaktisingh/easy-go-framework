Here, we put our plugins and Modules to extend the existing functionality
There will be two way to extend existing functionality
1. Use already available Hooks and plugin your code with the appropriate hook(We usually use Hooks when there is not much modifications and a data object needs to be updated )
2. Override the existing module using "Inheritance" and alter the existing functionality in your own module, you don't need to override
each and every method of module-controller, you just need to override the method which needs to be updated according to the new requirement
